For any Machine Learning Project, what are some of the important
considerations, apart from minimizing the error? Any Data or Model
considerations you may think of? How do they affect the choice of your model,
data, metrics etc.

One important consideration in a machine learning project is what model you
want to choose. Ideally, simple is better as it reduces the chances of
overfitting and generalizes better than a more complex model. Consider a
situation where linear regression and a deep neural network are used on the
same set of features, and both approximate the expected values well (low in
sample error). Due to the approximation generalization tradeoff, one should use
the linear regression model because it is less complex and, therefore, more
likely to generalize the data set better. Also, this is related to the ensemble
methods we discussed in class. For instance, if generalization is a priority,
one would use bagging, but if lowering bias is a priority, one would use
boosting.
