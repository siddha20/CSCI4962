Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3; stylized GPTÂ·3) is a popular autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Given an initial text as prompt, it will produce text that continues the prompt.GPT-3, specifically the Codex model, is the basis for GitHub Copilot, a code completion and generation software that can be used in various code editors and IDEs. There are many such applications of this model. Explore 2-3 of its other popular applications and describe those in 1-2 lines. Conversely, do you think there are any downsides and/or limitations of this model? Explain.


A popular use for GPT-3 is for chatbots. Often, these kinds of chatbots are employed by businesses as the first line of communication for customer support needs. Also, GPT-3 is very good at autocompletion. Not only is it good at natural language auto-completion, but it (Codex, a descendant of GPT-3) also can be used for auto-completing code, as seen by GitHub Copilot. Despite these impressive applications of GPT-3, there are valid concerns. Firstly, there are ethical issues. The model is biased in race, gender, and religion. Also, GPT-3 can be used for malicious reasons. For instance, one can use GPT-3 to generate false information; consider this article written by GPT-3: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3.
