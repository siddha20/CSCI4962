What type of problems do you think you can solve using Deep Neural Networks
only? In what type of ML problems would you prefer other ML models over Neural
Networks? How will you weigh the advantages of one over the other when deciding
your model?

Deep neural networks are widely used in creating recommendation systems and
doing classification tasks. Whenever there is an abundance of raw data, black
box methods such as deep neural networks can perform very well. However, the
general difficulty in trying to understand what a deep neural network does may
be a reason to use other machine learning methods. For example, an output from
a decision tree can be backtracked up the tree to see how the decision was
made, but backtracking a decision from a deep neural network is highly
nontrivial. Some things to consider when choosing a model are the type/size of
data available, the complexity of the model versus the task at hand (Occam's
Razor), etc.
