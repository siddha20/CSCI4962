During our discussion of Recommender Systems we primarily discussed some basic
techniques including some deep learning models used to solve the recommendation
problem. Cold-Start problem in recommendations is a significant issue (new user
or item). For a platform like twitter, what are some of the major challenges
that can occur when recommending items to new users? What could be some of the
ways using which we can solve the cold start problem? Please cite your sources,
if you are making suggestions based on existing solutions. However, I would
like to see some of your own ideas and suggestions here.


Forming recommendations for new users is hard for the system because the system
usually does not have any prior data about the user. This is known as the cold
start problem, and platforms such as Twitter usually combat it by asking users
to pick out certain things when they first sign up. For example, when signing
up for an account, Twitter will first ask to "select at least 3 interests to
personalize your Twitter experience." Some of the options are music,
entertainment, sports, etc. The next thing they ask is to pick specific things
within those categories. By doing this, Twitter now has a basis for
recommending things, and as the user continues to use the service, more
feedback will be fed to the system to improve recommendations.
