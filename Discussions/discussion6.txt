This week we started learning about unsupervised learning models in the Deep Learning Space. Discuss, any deep generative-discriminative/encoder-decoder model that can be used to solve the problems that are NOT related to Computer Vision (e.g. Anomaly Detection in Finance, Medical Applications etc.). Give a high level description of the overall methodology. In practice, are these (other) fields utilizing these deep learning techniques? Why or why not?

One interesting use of unsupervised learning is using GANs to generate human motion behavior. Moreover, using GANs to generate a path that a human would take in a physical environment. This application of GANs is helpful for self-driving cars, where this data can be used to improve driving decisions. In theory, this seems like a creative approach to overcoming a limited amount of available data; however, I can see some concerns with self-driving cars in the real world driving around trained on synthetic data.
