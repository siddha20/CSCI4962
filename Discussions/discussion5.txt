Overfitting, exploding gradient, and class imbalance are the major challenges
while training your CNN models. These issues can impact the performance of your
model. We discussed a few in class. Discuss some of the recent advances in
Computer Vision and CNN research that can help deal with these issues? (You may
refer to research papers and articles online: Don't forget to cite them).


Class imbalance arises in image classification problems when there might be an
abundance of some type of image and scarcity of another image in the same
classification domain. There are certain tricks to use when training a CNN to
fight this imbalance. One trick is at the data level, where you over sample the
minority class of image and undersample from the majority class [1]. This is
relatively easy to implement and is a popular approach. Another trick is at the
classifier level, where you can assign a different cost when misclassifying a
sample. The cost is any way to place more importance on misclassifying a
minority sample. For instance, a CNN that is cost-sensitive can modify the
learning rate when a minority sample is misclassified such that the magnitude
of the weight update is higher [1].
