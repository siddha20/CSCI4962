What are some of the important problems you think machine learning and AI has
solved so far? 

Some important problems that machine learning and AI have solved so far include
computer vision tasks (e.g. image classification, object detection), natural
language processing (e.g. Siri), and also general classification problems like
credit risk.

What are some of the areas that still remain unexplored from the perspective of
AI applications?

Some areas within AI that remain unexplored are ways to remove ethnic biases
that may be present as a result of the data set being used. For example, there
was a facial recognition system used at Heathrow that caused darker skinned
people to fail much more frequently compared to white people. 

How can AI benefit some of the less explored areas of research and application?

I am not well versed in the field of cybersecurity; however, I feel that AI can
greatly benefit the security of systems by being able to recognize
vulnerabilities that humans cannot, or maybe even use AI as opponents to test
the security of a system.
